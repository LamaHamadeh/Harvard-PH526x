#A list of numbers can be very unsmooth, meaning very high numbers can be right next to very low numbers. 
#This list may represent a smooth path in reality that is masked with random noise (for example, 
#satellite trajectories with inaccurate transmission). One way to smooth the values in the list is to 
#replace each value with the average of each value's neighbors, including the value itself.

#-------------------------------------------------

#3a

#Let's make a function moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors) that takes a list x and the number of neighbors
# n_neighbors on either side to consider. For each value, the function computes the average of each value's 
#neighbors, including themselves. Have the function return a list of these averaged values that is the same 
#length as the original list. If there are not enough neighbors (for cases near the edge), substitute the 
#original value as many times as there are missing neighbors.
#Use your function to find the moving window sum of x=[0,10,5,3,1,5] and n_neighbors=1.


import random

random.seed(1) #Initialize the basic random number generator.

def moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors=1):
    n = len(x)
    width = n_neighbors*2 + 1
    x = [x[0]]*n_neighbors + x + [x[-1]]*n_neighbors
    # To complete the function,
    # return a list of the mean of values from i to i+width for all values i from 0 to n-1.
    return [sum(x[i:(i+width)]) / width for i in range(n)]

#moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors) is pre-loaded into memory from 3a.

#Store x as well as each of these averages as consecutive lists in a list called Y.

#moving_window_average(x, n_neighbors=2) and Y are already loaded into memory. 
#For each list in Y, calculate and store the range (the maximum minus the minimum) in a new list ranges.
#Print your answer. As the window width increases, does the range of each list increase or decrease? 
#Why do you think that is?

ranges = [max(x)-min(x) for x in Y]
print(ranges) #The range decreases, because the average smooths a larger number of neighbors. 
#Because the numbers in the original list are just random, we expect the average of many of them to be 
#roughly 1 / 2, and more averaging means more smoothness in this value.
